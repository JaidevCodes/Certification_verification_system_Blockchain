  <b>Blockchain-Based Certificate Verification System</b><br/>
  Final Year Major Project (B.Tech – Computer Science & Engineering)
</p>

---

## 📌 Project Overview

CertChain is a **Blockchain-Based Certificate Verification System** designed to issue, store, and verify academic or professional certificates in a **secure, tamper-proof, and decentralised manner**.

The system leverages **blockchain technology (Polygon Amoy Testnet)** and **IPFS (via Pinata)** to eliminate certificate forgery, reduce manual verification, and provide instant public validation using smart contracts.

This project was developed as a **Final Year Major Project** under the guidance of our faculty mentor at **I.K. Gujral Punjab Technical University, Mohali Campus – 1**.
